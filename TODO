# TODO for nclvalidator

**Warning: This TODO list is not up to date**

0. Validate focusSrc, focusSelSrc, etc, documentURI,...

1. Support profiles validation based on the xmlns attribute.

We currently do not hanle the three profiles supported by NCL (EDTV, BDTV e
CausalConnector):

If the xmlns attribute of  <ncl> is 'http://www.ncl.org.br/NCL3.0/EDTVProfile',
then we should validate the way we are doing today.

If the xmlns attribute of <ncl> is 'http://www.ncl.org.br/NCL3.0/BDTVProfile',
then we should:

  - accept ONLY <meta>, <metadata>, and <transactionBase> (excluding
    <transaction>) in the <head>

If the xmlns attribute of <ncl> is
'http://www.ncl.org.br/NCL3.0/CausalConnectorProfile', then, whe should:

  - accept only the following structure (and children)

    <ncl>
      <head>
        <connectorBase>
          <causalConnector/>
        </connectorBase>
      </head>
    </ncl>


2. The region attribute of  <regionBase> needs to be a <region> that is not
   children of device="systemAudio(1)" ordevice="systemScreen(1)".

3. Problems with URI codification. For instance, spaces can be %20.  This may
   cause some inconsistencies and wrong validations false-negatives).

4. Generate a warning when the extension of the src attribute in a <media> is
   not equivalent to the type attribute of the <media>.

5. Refer validation: generate an error message when pointing to some parent (or
   grandparent, etc.) of the element doing the refer.

6. Load external error messages.

7. Use Reference class to validate references.  We implemented it later so that
  most of the validation is still hand made.  This class was mainly created for
  NCL Eclipse, but it can also be very useful here.

8. Check if the connectorParam was declared when it is required (this is very hard!).
  For that, we need to check if the variable is being used by that action or
  assesmentStatement, and then check if it has been declared in a <linkParam> or
  <bindParam> of the <bind> using the <causalConnector>.

9. Validate the set action when there is no interface attribute on <bind>.

10. constituent is not being correctly validated.

11. Validate src attribute of <media> containing spaces.

12. Validate if every children of <switch> is being pointed by a <bindRule> of
    <defaultComponent>.
	
## Datatypes

  - percentages is not handling '.', e.g. 10.00 does not work!

## Still not working

  - Component of the <bind> element!
  - When attribute role is "set", the component/bind attributes of <bind>
    should point to a <property>
  - switchPort
  - descriptorSwitch
  - defaultDescriptor
  - rule
  - compositeRule
  - bindRule
